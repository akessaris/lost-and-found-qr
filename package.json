  "description": "MongoDB and Node.js are often used together because of their shared use of Javascript and its Object Notation (JSON).  Mongoose is a popular helper library that provides a more rigorous modeling environment for your data, enforcing a little bit more structure as needed, while still maintaining flexibility that makes MongoDB powerful.  In this article, you make a connection to a hosted MongoDB instance at add-on provider [MongoLab](http://mongolab.com) with Mongoose and model a simple object.",
